egeon
proceed solinus to procure my fall
and by the doom of death end woes and all

duke
merchant of syracusa plead no more
i am not partial to infringe our laws
the enmity and discord which of late
sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
to merchants our well dealing countrymen
who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods
excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks
for since the mortal and intestine jars
’twixt thy seditious countrymen and us
it hath in solemn synods been decreed
both by the syracusians and ourselves
to admit no traffic to our adverse towns
nay more if any born at ephesus
be seen at syracusian marts and fairs
again if any syracusian born
come to the bay of ephesus he dies
his goods confiscate to the duke’s dispose
unless a thousand marks be levied
to quit the penalty and to ransom him
thy substance valued at the highest rate
cannot amount unto a hundred marks
therefore by law thou art condemn’d to die

egeon
yet this my comfort when your words are done
my woes end likewise with the evening sun

duke
well syracusian say in brief the cause
why thou departedst from thy native home
and for what cause thou cam’st to ephesus

egeon
a heavier task could not have been impos’d
than i to speak my griefs unspeakable
yet that the world may witness that my end
was wrought by nature not by vile offence
i’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave
in syracusa was i born and wed
unto a woman happy but for me
and by me had not our hap been bad
with her i liv’d in joy our wealth increas’d
by prosperous voyages i often made
to epidamnum till my factor’s death
and the great care of goods at random left
drew me from kind embracements of my spouse
from whom my absence was not six months old
before herself almost at fainting under
the pleasing punishment that women bear
had made provision for her following me
and soon and safe arrived where i was
there had she not been long but she became
a joyful mother of two goodly sons
and which was strange the one so like the other
as could not be distinguish’d but by names
that very hour and in the self same inn
a mean woman was delivered
of such a burden male twins both alike
those for their parents were exceeding poor
i bought and brought up to attend my sons
my wife not meanly proud of two such boys
made daily motions for our home return
unwilling i agreed alas too soon
we came aboard
a league from epidamnum had we sail’d
before the always wind obeying deep
gave any tragic instance of our harm
but longer did we not retain much hope
for what obscured light the heavens did grant
did but convey unto our fearful minds
a doubtful warrant of immediate death
which though myself would gladly have embrac’d
yet the incessant weepings of my wife
weeping before for what she saw must come
and piteous plainings of the pretty babes
that mourn’d for fashion ignorant what to fear
forc’d me to seek delays for them and me
and this it was for other means was none
the sailors sought for safety by our boat
and left the ship then sinking ripe to us
my wife more careful for the latter born
had fast’ned him unto a small spare mast
such as sea faring men provide for storms
to him one of the other twins was bound
whilst i had been like heedful of the other
the children thus dispos’d my wife and i
fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d
fast’ned ourselves at either end the mast
and floating straight obedient to the stream
was carried towards corinth as we thought
at length the sun gazing upon the earth
dispers’d those vapours that offended us
and by the benefit of his wished light
the seas wax’d calm and we discovered
two ships from far making amain to us
of corinth that of epidaurus this
but ere they came—o let me say no more!
gather the sequel by that went before

duke
nay forward old man do not break off so
for we may pity though not pardon thee

egeon
o had the gods done so i had not now
worthily term’d them merciless to us
for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues
we were encountered by a mighty rock
which being violently borne upon
our helpful ship was splitted in the midst
so that in this unjust divorce of us
fortune had left to both of us alike
what to delight in what to sorrow for
her part poor soul seeming as burdened
with lesser weight but not with lesser woe
was carried with more speed before the wind
and in our sight they three were taken up
by fishermen of corinth as we thought
at length another ship had seiz’d on us
and knowing whom it was their hap to save
gave healthful welcome to their ship wrack’d guests
and would have reft the fishers of their prey
had not their bark been very slow of sail
and therefore homeward did they bend their course
thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss
that by misfortunes was my life prolong’d
to tell sad stories of my own mishaps

duke
and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
do me the favour to dilate at full
what have befall’n of them and thee till now

egeon
my youngest boy and yet my eldest care
at eighteen years became inquisitive
after his brother and importun’d me
that his attendant so his case was like
reft of his brother but retain’d his name
might bear him company in the quest of him
whom whilst i laboured of a love to see
i hazarded the loss of whom i lov’d
five summers have i spent in farthest greece
roaming clean through the bounds of asia
and coasting homeward came to ephesus
hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought
or that or any place that harbours men
but here must end the story of my life
and happy were i in my timely death
could all my travels warrant me they live

duke
hapless egeon whom the fates have mark’d
to bear the extremity of dire mishap
now trust me were it not against our laws
against my crown my oath my dignity
which princes would they may not disannul
my soul should sue as advocate for thee
but though thou art adjudged to the death
and passed sentence may not be recall’d
but to our honour’s great disparagement
yet will i favour thee in what i can
therefore merchant i’ll limit thee this day
to seek thy health by beneficial help
try all the friends thou hast in ephesus
beg thou or borrow to make up the sum
and live if no then thou art doom’d to die
jailer take him to thy custody

jailer
i will my lord

egeon
hopeless and helpless doth egeon wend
but to procrastinate his lifeless end

 exeunt

scene ii a public place

 enter antipholus and dromio of syracuse and a merchant

merchant
therefore give out you are of epidamnum
lest that your goods too soon be confiscate
this very day a syracusian merchant
is apprehended for arrival here
and not being able to buy out his life
according to the statute of the town
dies ere the weary sun set in the west
there is your money that i had to keep

antipholus of syracuse
go bear it to the centaur where we host
and stay there dromio till i come to thee
within this hour it will be dinnertime
till that i’ll view the manners of the town
peruse the traders gaze upon the buildings
and then return and sleep within mine inn
for with long travel i am stiff and weary
get thee away

dromio of syracuse
many a man would take you at your word
and go indeed having so good a mean

 exit dromio

antipholus of syracuse
a trusty villain sir that very oft
when i am dull with care and melancholy
lightens my humour with his merry jests
what will you walk with me about the town
and then go to my inn and dine with me

merchant
i am invited sir to certain merchants
of whom i hope to make much benefit
i crave your pardon soon at five o’clock
please you i’ll meet with you upon the mart
and afterward consort you till bedtime
my present business calls me from you now

antipholus of syracuse
farewell till then i will go lose myself
and wander up and down to view the city

merchant
sir i commend you to your own content

 exit merchant

antipholus of syracuse
he that commends me to mine own content
commends me to the thing i cannot get
i to the world am like a drop of water
that in the ocean seeks another drop
who failing there to find his fellow forth
unseen inquisitive confounds himself
so i to find a mother and a brother
in quest of them unhappy lose myself

 enter dromio of ephesus

here comes the almanac of my true date
what now how chance thou art return’d so soon

dromio of ephesus
return’d so soon rather approach’d too late
the capon burns the pig falls from the spit
the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell
my mistress made it one upon my cheek
she is so hot because the meat is cold
the meat is cold because you come not home
you come not home because you have no stomach
you have no stomach having broke your fast
but we that know what ’tis to fast and pray
are penitent for your default today

antipholus of syracuse
stop in your wind sir tell me this i pray
where have you left the money that i gave you

dromio of ephesus
o sixpence that i had o’ wednesday last
to pay the saddler for my mistress’ crupper
the saddler had it sir i kept it not

antipholus of syracuse
i am not in a sportive humour now
tell me and dally not where is the money
we being strangers here how dar’st thou trust
so great a charge from thine own custody

dromio of ephesus
i pray you jest sir as you sit at dinner
i from my mistress come to you in post
if i return i shall be post indeed
for she will score your fault upon my pate
methinks your maw like mine should be your clock
and strike you home without a messenger

antipholus of syracuse
come dromio come these jests are out of season
reserve them till a merrier hour than this
where is the gold i gave in charge to thee

dromio of ephesus
to me sir why you gave no gold to me!

antipholus of syracuse
come on sir knave have done your foolishness
and tell me how thou hast dispos’d thy charge

dromio of ephesus
my charge was but to fetch you from the mart
home to your house the phoenix sir to dinner
my mistress and her sister stay for you

antipholus of syracuse
now as i am a christian answer me
in what safe place you have bestow’d my money
or i shall break that merry sconce of yours
that stands on tricks when i am undispos’d
where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me

dromio of ephesus
i have some marks of yours upon my pate
some of my mistress’ marks upon my shoulders
but not a thousand marks between you both
if i should pay your worship those again
perchance you will not bear them patiently

antipholus of syracuse
thy mistress’ marks what mistress slave hast thou

dromio of ephesus
your worship’s wife my mistress at the phoenix
she that doth fast till you come home to dinner
and prays that you will hie you home to dinner

antipholus of syracuse

being forbid there take you that sir knave

dromio of ephesus
what mean you sir for god’s sake hold your hands
nay an you will not sir i’ll take my heels

 exit dromio

antipholus of syracuse
upon my life by some device or other
the villain is o’er raught of all my money
they say this town is full of cozenage
as nimble jugglers that deceive the eye
dark working sorcerers that change the mind
soul killing witches that deform the body
disguised cheaters prating mountebanks
and many such like liberties of sin
if it prove so i will be gone the sooner
i’ll to the centaur to go seek this slave
i greatly fear my money is not safe

 exit



act ii

scene i a public place

 enter adriana wife to antipholus of ephesus with luciana her
 sister

adriana
neither my husband nor the slave return’d
that in such haste i sent to seek his master
sure luciana it is two o’clock

luciana
perhaps some merchant hath invited him
and from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner
good sister let us dine and never fret
a man is master of his liberty
time is their master and when they see time
they’ll go or come if so be patient sister

adriana
why should their liberty than ours be more

luciana
because their business still lies out o’ door

adriana
look when i serve him so he takes it ill

luciana
o know he is the bridle of your will

adriana
there’s none but asses will be bridled so

luciana
why headstrong liberty is lash’d with woe
there’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye
but hath his bound in earth in sea in sky
the beasts the fishes and the winged fowls
are their males’ subjects and at their controls
man more divine the masters of all these
lord of the wide world and wild wat’ry seas
indued with intellectual sense and souls
of more pre eminence than fish and fowls
are masters to their females and their lords
then let your will attend on their accords

adriana
this servitude makes you to keep unwed

luciana
not this but troubles of the marriage bed

adriana
but were you wedded you would bear some sway

luciana
ere i learn love i’ll practise to obey

adriana
how if your husband start some other where

luciana
till he come home again i would forbear

adriana
patience unmov’d! no marvel though she pause
they can be meek that have no other cause
a wretched soul bruis’d with adversity
we bid be quiet when we hear it cry
but were we burd’ned with like weight of pain
as much or more we should ourselves complain
so thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee
with urging helpless patience would relieve me
but if thou live to see like right bereft
this fool begg’d patience in thee will be left

luciana
well i will marry one day but to try
here comes your man now is your husband nigh

 enter dromio of ephesus

adriana
say is your tardy master now at hand

dromio of ephesus
nay he’s at two hands with me and that my two ears can witness

adriana
say didst thou speak with him know’st thou his mind

dromio of ephesus
ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear
beshrew his hand i scarce could understand it

luciana
spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning

dromio of ephesus
nay he struck so plainly i could too well feel his blows and withal
so doubtfully that i could scarce understand them

adriana
but say i prithee is he coming home
it seems he hath great care to please his wife

dromio of ephesus
why mistress sure my master is horn mad

adriana
horn mad thou villain

dromio of ephesus
i mean not cuckold mad
but sure he’s stark mad
when i desir’d him to come home to dinner
he ask’d me for a thousand marks in gold
“’tis dinner time” quoth i “my gold” quoth he
“your meat doth burn” quoth i “my gold” quoth he
“will you come home” quoth i “my gold” quoth he
“where is the thousand marks i gave thee villain”
“the pig” quoth i “is burn’d” “my gold” quoth he
“my mistress sir” quoth i “hang up thy mistress
i know not thy mistress out on thy mistress!”

luciana
quoth who

dromio of ephesus
quoth my master
“i know” quoth he “no house no wife no mistress”
so that my errand due unto my tongue
i thank him i bare home upon my shoulders
for in conclusion he did beat me there

adriana
go back again thou slave and fetch him home

dromio of ephesus
go back again and be new beaten home
for god’s sake send some other messenger

adriana
back slave or i will break thy pate across

dromio of ephesus
and he will bless that cross with other beating
between you i shall have a holy head

adriana
hence prating peasant fetch thy master home

dromio of ephesus
am i so round with you as you with me
that like a football you do spurn me thus
you spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither
if i last in this service you must case me in leather

 exit

luciana
fie how impatience loureth in your face

adriana
his company must do his minions grace
whilst i at home starve for a merry look
hath homely age th’ alluring beauty took
from my poor cheek then he hath wasted it
are my discourses dull barren my wit
if voluble and sharp discourse be marr’d
unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
do their gay vestments his affections bait
that’s not my fault he’s master of my state
what ruins are in me that can be found
by him not ruin’d then is he the ground
of my defeatures my decayed fair
a sunny look of his would soon repair
but too unruly deer he breaks the pale
and feeds from home poor i am but his stale

luciana
self harming jealousy! fie beat it hence

adriana
unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense
i know his eye doth homage otherwhere
or else what lets it but he would be here
sister you know he promis’d me a chain
would that alone a love he would detain
so he would keep fair quarter with his bed
i see the jewel best enamelled
will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still
that others touch yet often touching will
wear gold and no man that hath a name
by falsehood and corruption doth it shame
since that my beauty cannot please his eye
i’ll weep what’s left away and weeping die

luciana
how many fond fools serve mad jealousy!

 exeunt

scene ii the same

 enter antipholus of syracuse

antipholus of syracuse
the gold i gave to dromio is laid up
safe at the centaur and the heedful slave
is wander’d forth in care to seek me out
by computation and mine host’s report
i could not speak with dromio since at first
i sent him from the mart see here he comes

 enter dromio of syracuse

how now sir! is your merry humour alter’d
as you love strokes so jest with me again
you know no centaur you receiv’d no gold
your mistress sent to have me home to dinner
my house was at the phoenix wast thou mad
that thus so madly thou didst answer me

dromio of syracuse
what answer sir when spake i such a word

antipholus of syracuse
even now even here not half an hour since

dromio of syracuse
i did not see you since you sent me hence
home to the centaur with the gold you gave me

antipholus of syracuse
villain thou didst deny the gold’s receipt
and told’st me of a mistress and a dinner
for which i hope thou felt’st i was displeas’d

dromio of syracuse
i am glad to see you in this merry vein
what means this jest i pray you master tell me

antipholus of syracuse
yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth
think’st thou i jest hold take thou that and that

 beats dromio

dromio of syracuse
hold sir for god’s sake now your jest is earnest
upon what bargain do you give it me

antipholus of syracuse
because that i familiarly sometimes
do use you for my fool and chat with you
your sauciness will jest upon my love
and make a common of my serious hours
when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport
but creep in crannies when he hides his beams
if you will jest with me know my aspect
and fashion your demeanour to my looks
or i will beat this method in your sconce

dromio of syracuse
sconce call you it so you would leave battering i had rather have it
a head and you use these blows long i must get a sconce for my head
and ensconce it too or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders but i
pray sir why am i beaten

antipholus of syracuse
dost thou not know

dromio of syracuse
nothing sir but that i am beaten

antipholus of syracuse
shall i tell you why

dromio of syracuse
ay sir and wherefore for they say every why hath a wherefore

antipholus of syracuse
why first for flouting me and then wherefore
for urging it the second time to me

dromio of syracuse
was there ever any man thus beaten out of season
when in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason
well sir i thank you

antipholus of syracuse
thank me sir for what

dromio of syracuse
marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing

antipholus of syracuse
i’ll make you amends next to give you nothing for something
but say sir is it dinner time

dromio of syracuse
no sir i think the meat wants that i have

antipholus of syracuse
in good time sir what’s that

dromio of syracuse
basting

antipholus of syracuse
well sir then ’twill be dry

dromio of syracuse
if it be sir i pray you eat none of it

antipholus of syracuse
your reason

dromio of syracuse
lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting

antipholus of syracuse
well sir learn to jest in good time
there’s a time for all things

dromio of syracuse
i durst have denied that before you were so choleric

antipholus of syracuse
by what rule sir

dromio of syracuse
marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father time
himself

antipholus of syracuse
let’s hear it

dromio of syracuse
there’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by
nature

antipholus of syracuse
may he not do it by fine and recovery

dromio of syracuse
yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another
man

antipholus of syracuse
why is time such a niggard of hair being as it is so plentiful an
excrement

dromio of syracuse
because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts and what he hath
scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit

antipholus of syracuse
why but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit

dromio of syracuse
not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair

antipholus of syracuse
why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit

dromio of syracuse
the plainer dealer the sooner lost yet he loseth it in a kind of
jollity

antipholus of syracuse
for what reason

dromio of syracuse
for two and sound ones too

antipholus of syracuse
nay not sound i pray you

dromio of syracuse
sure ones then

antipholus of syracuse
nay not sure in a thing falsing

dromio of syracuse
certain ones then

antipholus of syracuse
name them

dromio of syracuse
the one to save the money that he spends in tiring the other that at
dinner they should not drop in his porridge

antipholus of syracuse
you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things

dromio of syracuse
marry and did sir namely e’en no time to recover hair lost by
nature

antipholus of syracuse
but your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover

dromio of syracuse
thus i mend it time himself is bald and therefore to the world’s end
will have bald followers

antipholus of syracuse
i knew ’twould be a bald conclusion
but soft! who wafts us yonder

 enter adriana and luciana

adriana
ay ay antipholus look strange and frown
some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects
i am not adriana nor thy wife
the time was once when thou unurg’d wouldst vow
that never words were music to thine ear
that never object pleasing in thine eye
that never touch well welcome to thy hand
that never meat sweet savour’d in thy taste
unless i spake or look’d or touch’d or carv’d to thee
how comes it now my husband o how comes it
that thou art then estranged from thyself
thyself i call it being strange to me
that undividable incorporate
am better than thy dear self’s better part
ah do not tear away thyself from me
for know my love as easy mayst thou fall
a drop of water in the breaking gulf
and take unmingled thence that drop again
without addition or diminishing
as take from me thyself and not me too
how dearly would it touch thee to the quick
should’st thou but hear i were licentious
and that this body consecrate to thee
by ruffian lust should be contaminate
wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
and hurl the name of husband in my face
and tear the stain’d skin off my harlot brow
and from my false hand cut the wedding ring
and break it with a deep divorcing vow
i know thou canst and therefore see thou do it
i am possess’d with an adulterate blot
my blood is mingled with the crime of lust
for if we two be one and thou play false
i do digest the poison of thy flesh
being strumpeted by thy contagion
keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed
i live distain’d thou undishonoured

antipholus of syracuse
plead you to me fair dame i know you not
in ephesus i am but two hours old
as strange unto your town as to your talk
who every word by all my wit being scann’d
wants wit in all one word to understand

luciana
fie brother how the world is chang’d with you
when were you wont to use my sister thus
she sent for you by dromio home to dinner

antipholus of syracuse
by dromio

dromio of syracuse
by me

adriana
by thee and this thou didst return from him
that he did buffet thee and in his blows
denied my house for his me for his wife

antipholus of syracuse
did you converse sir with this gentlewoman
what is the course and drift of your compact

dromio of syracuse
i sir i never saw her till this time

antipholus of syracuse
villain thou liest for even her very words
didst thou deliver to me on the mart

dromio of syracuse
i never spake with her in all my life

antipholus of syracuse
how can she thus then call us by our names
unless it be by inspiration

adriana
how ill agrees it with your gravity
to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave
abetting him to thwart me in my mood
be it my wrong you are from me exempt
but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
come i will fasten on this sleeve of thine
thou art an elm my husband i a vine
whose weakness married to thy stronger state
makes me with thy strength to communicate
if aught possess thee from me it is dross
usurping ivy brier or idle moss
who all for want of pruning with intrusion
infect thy sap and live on thy confusion

antipholus of syracuse
to me she speaks she moves me for her theme
what was i married to her in my dream
or sleep i now and think i hear all this
what error drives our eyes and ears amiss
until i know this sure uncertainty
i’ll entertain the offer’d fallacy

luciana
dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner

dromio of syracuse
o for my beads! i cross me for a sinner
this is the fairy land o spite of spites!
we talk with goblins owls and sprites
if we obey them not this will ensue
they’ll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue

luciana
why prat’st thou to thyself and answer’st not
dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot

dromio of syracuse

dromio of syracuse

luciana

dromio of syracuse
’tis true she rides me and i long for grass
’tis so i am an ass else it could never be
but i should know her as well as she knows me

adriana

to put the finger in the eye and weep
whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn
come sir to dinner dromio keep the gate

and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
sirrah if any ask you for your master
say he dines forth and let no creature enter

antipholus of syracuse

sleeping or waking mad or well advis’d
known unto these and to myself disguis’d!

 goldsmith and balthasar the merchant

antipholus of ephesus

my wife is shrewish when i keep not hours

to see the making of her carcanet
and that tomorrow you will bring it home
but here’s a villain that would face me down
he met me on the mart and that i beat him
and charg’d him with a thousand marks in gold
and that i did deny my wife and house
thou drunkard thou what didst thou mean by this

dromio of ephesus
say what you will sir but i know what i know
that you beat me at the mart i have your hand to show
if the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink
your own handwriting would tell you what i think

antipholus of ephesus
i think thou art an ass

dromio of ephesus
marry so it doth appear
by the wrongs i suffer and the blows i bear

balthasar
i hold your dainties cheap sir and your welcome dear

antipholus of ephesus

a table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish

balthasar
good meat sir is common that every churl affords

antipholus of ephesus
and welcome more common for that’s nothing but words

balthasar
small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast

antipholus of ephesus

antipholus of ephesus

adriana

balthasar
in debating which was best we shall part with neither

dromio of ephesus
they stand at the door master bid them welcome hither

antipholus of ephesus
there is something in the wind that we cannot get in

dromio of ephesus
you would say so master if your garments were thin
your cake here is warm within you stand here in the cold
it would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold

antipholus of ephesus
go fetch me something i’ll break ope the gate

dromio of syracuse
break any breaking here and i’ll break your knave’s pate

dromio of ephesus

dromio of syracuse

dromio of ephesus

if a crow help us in sirrah we’ll pluck a crow together

antipholus of ephesus
go get thee gone fetch me an iron crow

balthasar
have patience sir o let it not be so
herein you war against your reputation
and draw within the compass of suspect
the unviolated honour of your wife
once this—your long experience of her wisdom
her sober virtue years and modesty
plead on her part some cause to you unknown
and doubt not sir but she will well excuse
why at this time the doors are made against you
be rul’d by me depart in patience
and let us to the tiger all to dinner
and about evening come yourself alone
to know the reason of this strange restraint
if by strong hand you offer to break in
now in the stirring passage of the day
a vulgar comment will be made of it
and that supposed by the common rout
against your yet ungalled estimation
that may with foul intrusion enter in
and dwell upon your grave when you are dead
for slander lives upon succession
for ever hous’d where it gets possession

antipholus of ephesus
you have prevail’d i will depart in quiet
and in despite of mirth mean to be merry
i know a wench of excellent discourse
pretty and witty wild and yet too gentle
there will we dine this woman that i mean
my wife but i protest without desert
hath oftentimes upbraided me withal
to her will we to dinner—get you home
and fetch the chain by this i know ’tis made
bring it i pray you to the porpentine
for there’s the house that chain will i bestow
be it for nothing but to spite my wife
upon mine hostess there good sir make haste
since mine own doors refuse to entertain me
i’ll knock elsewhere to see if they’ll disdain me

angelo
i’ll meet you at that place some hour hence

antipholus of ephesus
do so this jest shall cost me some expense

 exeunt

scene ii the same

 enter luciana with antipholus of syracuse

luciana
and may it be that you have quite forgot
a husband’s office shall antipholus
even in the spring of love thy love springs rot
shall love in building grow so ruinous
if you did wed my sister for her wealth
then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness
or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth
muffle your false love with some show of blindness
let not my sister read it in your eye
be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator
look sweet speak fair become disloyalty
apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger
bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted
teach sin the carriage of a holy saint
be secret false what need she be acquainted
what simple thief brags of his own attaint
’tis double wrong to truant with your bed
and let her read it in thy looks at board
shame hath a bastard fame well managed
ill deeds is doubled with an evil word
alas poor women make us but believe
being compact of credit that you love us
though others have the arm show us the sleeve
we in your motion turn and you may move us
then gentle brother get you in again
comfort my sister cheer her call her wife
’tis holy sport to be a little vain
when the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife

antipholus of syracuse
sweet mistress what your name is else i know not
nor by what wonder you do hit on mine
less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
than our earth’s wonder more than earth divine
teach me dear creature how to think and speak
lay open to my earthy gross conceit
smother’d in errors feeble shallow weak
the folded meaning of your words’ deceit
against my soul’s pure truth why labour you
to make it wander in an unknown field
are you a god would you create me new
transform me then and to your power i’ll yield
but if that i am i then well i know
your weeping sister is no wife of mine
nor to her bed no homage do i owe
far more far more to you do i decline
o train me not sweet mermaid with thy note
to drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears
sing siren for thyself and i will dote
spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs
and as a bed i’ll take thee and there lie
and in that glorious supposition think
he gains by death that hath such means to die
let love being light be drowned if she sink!

luciana
what are you mad that you do reason so

antipholus of syracuse
not mad but mated how i do not know

luciana
it is a fault that springeth from your eye

antipholus of syracuse
for gazing on your beams fair sun being by

luciana
gaze where you should and that will clear your sight

antipholus of syracuse
as good to wink sweet love as look on night

luciana
why call you me love call my sister so

antipholus of syracuse
thy sister’s sister

luciana
that’s my sister

antipholus of syracuse
no
it is thyself mine own self’s better part
mine eye’s clear eye my dear heart’s dearer heart
my food my fortune and my sweet hope’s aim
my sole earth’s heaven and my heaven’s claim

luciana
all this my sister is or else should be

antipholus of syracuse
call thyself sister sweet for i aim thee
thee will i love and with thee lead my life
thou hast no husband yet nor i no wife
give me thy hand

luciana
o soft sir hold you still
i’ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill

 exit luciana

antipholus of syracuse

antipholus of syracuse
what woman’s man and how besides thyself

dromio of syracuse
marry sir besides myself i am due to a woman one that claims me
one that haunts me one that will have me

antipholus of syracuse
what claim lays she to thee

dromio of syracuse
marry sir such claim as you would lay to your horse and she would
have me as a beast not that i being a beast she would have me but
that she being a very beastly creature lays claim to me

antipholus of syracuse
what is she

dromio of syracuse
a very reverent body ay such a one as a man may not speak of without
he say “sir reverence” i have but lean luck in the match and yet is
she a wondrous fat marriage

antipholus of syracuse
how dost thou mean a “fat marriage”

dromio of syracuse
marry sir she’s the kitchen wench and all grease and i know not
what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by
her own light i warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
poland winter if she lives till doomsday she’ll burn a week longer
than the whole world

antipholus of syracuse
what complexion is she of

dromio of syracuse
swart like my shoe but her face nothing like so clean kept for why
she sweats a man may go overshoes in the grime of it

antipholus of syracuse
that’s a fault that water will mend

dromio of syracuse
no sir ’tis in grain noah’s flood could not do it

antipholus of syracuse
what’s her name

dromio of syracuse
nell sir but her name and three quarters that’s an ell and three
quarters will not measure her from hip to hip

antipholus of syracuse
then she bears some breadth

dromio of syracuse
no longer from head to foot than from hip to hip she is spherical
like a globe i could find out countries in her

antipholus of syracuse
in what part of her body stands ireland

dromio of syracuse
marry sir in her buttocks i found it out by the bogs

antipholus of syracuse
where scotland

dromio of syracuse
i found it by the barrenness hard in the palm of the hand

antipholus of syracuse
where france

dromio of syracuse
in her forehead armed and reverted making war against her hair

antipholus of syracuse
where england

dromio of syracuse
i looked for the chalky cliffs but i could find no whiteness in them
but i guess it stood in her chin by the salt rheum that ran between
france and it

antipholus of syracuse
where spain

dromio of syracuse
faith i saw it not but i felt it hot in her breath

antipholus of syracuse
where america the indies

dromio of syracuse
o sir upon her nose all o’er embellished with rubies carbuncles
sapphires declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of spain who
sent whole armadoes of carracks to be ballast at her nose

antipholus of syracuse
where stood belgia the netherlands

dromio of syracuse
o sir i did not look so low to conclude this drudge or diviner laid
claim to me called me dromio swore i was assured to her told me what
privy marks i had about me as the mark of my shoulder the mole in my
neck the great wart on my left arm that i amazed ran from her as a
witch and i think if my breast had not been made of faith and my
heart of steel she had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me
turn i’ the wheel

antipholus of syracuse
go hie thee presently post to the road
and if the wind blow any way from shore
i will not harbour in this town tonight
if any bark put forth come to the mart
where i will walk till thou return to me
if everyone knows us and we know none
’tis time i think to trudge pack and be gone

dromio of syracuse
as from a bear a man would run for life
so fly i from her that would be my wife

 exit

antipholus of syracuse
there’s none but witches do inhabit here
and therefore ’tis high time that i were hence
she that doth call me husband even my soul
doth for a wife abhor but her fair sister
possess’d with such a gentle sovereign grace
of such enchanting presence and discourse
hath almost made me traitor to myself
but lest myself be guilty to self wrong
i’ll stop mine ears against the mermaid’s song

 enter angelo with the chain

angelo
master antipholus

antipholus of syracuse

and then receive my money for the chain

antipholus of syracuse
i pray you sir receive the money now
for fear you ne’er see chain nor money more

angelo
you are a merry man sir fare you well

 exit

antipholus of syracuse
what i should think of this i cannot tell
but this i think there’s no man is so vain
that would refuse so fair an offer’d chain
i see a man here needs not live by shifts
when in the streets he meets such golden gifts
i’ll to the mart and there for dromio stay
if any ship put out then straight away

angelo

is growing to me by antipholus
and in the instant that i met with you
he had of me a chain at five o’clock

antipholus of ephesus
a man is well holp up that trusts to you
i promised your presence and the chain
but neither chain nor goldsmith came to me
belike you thought our love would last too long
if it were chain’d together and therefore came not

angelo
saving your merry humour here’s the note
how much your chain weighs to the utmost carat
the fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion
which doth amount to three odd ducats more
than i stand debted to this gentleman
i pray you see him presently discharg’d
for he is bound to sea and stays but for it

antipholus of ephesus
i am not furnished with the present money
besides i have some business in the town
good signior take the stranger to my house
and with you take the chain and bid my wife
disburse the sum on the receipt thereof
perchance i will be there as soon as you

angelo
then you will bring the chain to her yourself

antipholus of ephesus
no bear it with you lest i come not time enough

angelo
well sir i will have you the chain about you

antipholus of ephesus
and if i have not sir i hope you have
or else you may return without your money

angelo
nay come i pray you sir give me the chain
both wind and tide stays for this gentleman
and i to blame have held him here too long

antipholus of ephesus
good lord you use this dalliance to excuse
your breach of promise to the porpentine
i should have chid you for not bringing it
but like a shrew you first begin to brawl

merchant
the hour steals on i pray you sir dispatch

angelo

antipholus of ephesus
why give it to my wife and fetch your money

angelo

either send the chain or send by me some token

antipholus of ephesus
fie now you run this humour out of breath
come where’s the chain i pray you let me see it

merchant
my business cannot brook this dalliance
good sir say whe’er you’ll answer me or no
if not i’ll leave him to the officer

antipholus of ephesus
i answer you what should i answer you

angelo

antipholus of ephesus
i owe you none till i receive the chain

angelo
you know i gave it you half an hour since

antipholus of ephesus
you gave me none you wrong me much to say so

angelo
you wrong me more sir in denying it
consider how it stands upon my credit

merchant
well officer arrest him at my suit

officer

luciana

one whose hard heart is button’d up with steel
a fiend a fairy pitiless and rough
a wolf nay worse a fellow all in buff
a back friend a shoulder clapper one that countermands
the passages of alleys creeks and narrow lands
a hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well
one that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell

habit of a light wench and thereof comes that the wenches say “god

written they appear to men like angels of light light is an effect of
fire and fire will burn ergo light wenches will burn come not near

and for the same he promis’d me a chain
both one and other he denies me now
the reason that i gather he is mad
besides this present instance of his rage
is a mad tale he told today at dinner
of his own doors being shut against his entrance
belike his wife acquainted with his fits
on purpose shut the doors against his way
my way is now to hie home to his house
and tell his wife that being lunatic

angelo
’tis so and that self chain about his neck
which he forswore most monstrously to have
good sir draw near to me i’ll speak to him
signior antipholus i wonder much
that you would put me to this shame and trouble
and not without some scandal to yourself
with circumstance and oaths so to deny
this chain which now you wear so openly
beside the charge the shame imprisonment
you have done wrong to this my honest friend
who but for staying on our controversy
had hoisted sail and put to sea today

fie on thee wretch ’tis pity that thou liv’st
to walk where any honest men resort

antipholus of syracuse

to fetch my poor distracted husband hence
let us come in that we may bind him fast
and bear him home for his recovery

angelo
i knew he was not in his perfect wits

merchant
i am sorry now that i did draw on him

abbess
how long hath this possession held the man

adriana
this week he hath been heavy sour sad
and much different from the man he was
but till this afternoon his passion
ne’er brake into extremity of rage

abbess
hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea
buried some dear friend hath not else his eye
stray’d his affection in unlawful love
a sin prevailing much in youthful men
who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
which of these sorrows is he subject to

adriana
to none of these except it be the last
namely some love that drew him oft from home

abbess
you should for that have reprehended him

adriana
why so i did

abbess
ay but not rough enough

adriana
as roughly as my modesty would let me

abbess
haply in private

adriana
and in assemblies too

abbess
ay but not enough

adriana
it was the copy of our conference
in bed he slept not for my urging it
at board he fed not for my urging it
alone it was the subject of my theme
in company i often glanced it
still did i tell him it was vile and bad

abbess
and thereof came it that the man was mad
the venom clamours of a jealous woman
poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth
it seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing
and thereof comes it that his head is light
thou say’st his meat was sauc’d with thy upbraidings
unquiet meals make ill digestions
thereof the raging fire of fever bred
and what’s a fever but a fit of madness
thou say’st his sports were hinder’d by thy brawls
sweet recreation barr’d what doth ensue
but moody and dull melancholy
kinsman to grim and comfortless despair
and at her heels a huge infectious troop
of pale distemperatures and foes to life
in food in sport and life preserving rest
to be disturb’d would mad or man or beast
the consequence is then thy jealous fits
hath scar’d thy husband from the use of’s wits

luciana
she never reprehended him but mildly
when he demean’d himself rough rude and wildly
why bear you these rebukes and answer not

adriana
she did betray me to my own reproof
good people enter and lay hold on him

abbess
no not a creature enters in my house

adriana
then let your servants bring my husband forth

abbess
neither he took this place for sanctuary
and it shall privilege him from your hands
till i have brought him to his wits again
or lose my labour in assaying it

adriana
i will attend my husband be his nurse
diet his sickness for it is my office
and will have no attorney but myself
and therefore let me have him home with me

abbess
be patient for i will not let him stir
till i have used the approved means i have
with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers
to make of him a formal man again
it is a branch and parcel of mine oath
a charitable duty of my order
therefore depart and leave him here with me

adriana
i will not hence and leave my husband here
and ill it doth beseem your holiness
to separate the husband and the wife

abbess
be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him

 exit abbess

luciana
complain unto the duke of this indignity

adriana
come go i will fall prostrate at his feet
and never rise until my tears and prayers
have won his grace to come in person hither
and take perforce my husband from the abbess

merchant
by this i think the dial points at five
anon i’m sure the duke himself in person
comes this way to the melancholy vale
the place of death and sorry execution
behind the ditches of the abbey here

angelo
upon what cause

merchant
to see a reverend syracusian merchant
who put unluckily into this bay
against the laws and statutes of this town
beheaded publicly for his offence

angelo
see where they come we will behold his death

luciana
kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey

 enter the duke attended egeon bareheaded with the headsman and
 other officers

justice most sacred duke against the abbess!

duke
she is a virtuous and a reverend lady
it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong

adriana
may it please your grace antipholus my husband
who i made lord of me and all i had
at your important letters this ill day
a most outrageous fit of madness took him
that desp’rately he hurried through the street
with him his bondman all as mad as he
doing displeasure to the citizens
by rushing in their houses bearing thence
rings jewels anything his rage did like
once did i get him bound and sent him home
whilst to take order for the wrongs i went
that here and there his fury had committed
anon i wot not by what strong escape
he broke from those that had the guard of him
and with his mad attendant and himself
each one with ireful passion with drawn swords
met us again and madly bent on us
chased us away till raising of more aid
we came again to bind them then they fled
into this abbey whither we pursued them
and here the abbess shuts the gates on us
and will not suffer us to fetch him out
nor send him forth that we may bear him hence
therefore most gracious duke with thy command
let him be brought forth and borne hence for help

duke
long since thy husband serv’d me in my wars
and i to thee engag’d a prince’s word
when thou didst make him master of thy bed
to do him all the grace and good i could
go some of you knock at the abbey gate
and bid the lady abbess come to me
i will determine this before i stir

she whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife
that hath abused and dishonour’d me
even in the strength and height of injury
beyond imagination is the wrong
that she this day hath shameless thrown on me

duke
discover how and thou shalt find me just

antipholus of ephesus
this day great duke she shut the doors upon me
while she with harlots feasted in my house

duke
a grievous fault say woman didst thou so

adriana
no my good lord myself he and my sister
today did dine together so befall my soul
as this is false he burdens me withal

luciana
ne’er may i look on day nor sleep on night
but she tells to your highness simple truth

angelo
o perjur’d woman! they are both forsworn
in this the madman justly chargeth them

antipholus of ephesus
my liege i am advised what i say
neither disturb’d with the effect of wine
nor heady rash provok’d with raging ire
albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
this woman lock’d me out this day from dinner
that goldsmith there were he not pack’d with her
could witness it for he was with me then
who parted with me to go fetch a chain
promising to bring it to the porpentine
where balthasar and i did dine together
our dinner done and he not coming thither
i went to seek him in the street i met him
and in his company that gentleman
there did this perjur’d goldsmith swear me down
that i this day of him receiv’d the chain
which god he knows i saw not for the which
he did arrest me with an officer
i did obey and sent my peasant home
for certain ducats he with none return’d
then fairly i bespoke the officer
to go in person with me to my house
by th’ way we met
my wife her sister and a rabble more
of vile confederates along with them
they brought one pinch a hungry lean faced villain
a mere anatomy a mountebank
a threadbare juggler and a fortune teller
a needy hollow ey’d sharp looking wretch
a living dead man this pernicious slave
forsooth took on him as a conjurer
and gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse
and with no face as ’twere outfacing me
cries out i was possess’d then altogether
they fell upon me bound me bore me thence
and in a dark and dankish vault at home
there left me and my man both bound together
till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder
i gain’d my freedom and immediately
ran hither to your grace whom i beseech
to give me ample satisfaction
for these deep shames and great indignities

angelo
my lord in truth thus far i witness with him
that he din’d not at home but was lock’d out

duke
but had he such a chain of thee or no

angelo
he had my lord and when he ran in here
these people saw the chain about his neck

merchant
besides i will be sworn these ears of mine
heard you confess you had the chain of him
after you first forswore it on the mart
and thereupon i drew my sword on you
and then you fled into this abbey here
from whence i think you are come by miracle

antipholus of ephesus
i never came within these abbey walls
nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me
i never saw the chain so help me heaven
and this is false you burden me withal

duke
why what an intricate impeach is this!
i think you all have drunk of circe’s cup
if here you hous’d him here he would have been
if he were mad he would not plead so coldly
you say he din’d at home the goldsmith here
denies that saying sirrah what say you

dromio of ephesus
sir he dined with her there at the porpentine

courtesan
he did and from my finger snatch’d that ring

antipholus of ephesus
’tis true my liege this ring i had of her

duke
saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here

courtesan
as sure my liege as i do see your grace

duke
why this is strange go call the abbess hither
i think you are all mated or stark mad

 exit one to the abbess

egeon
most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word
haply i see a friend will save my life
and pay the sum that may deliver me

duke
speak freely syracusian what thou wilt

egeon
is not your name sir call’d antipholus
and is not that your bondman dromio

dromio of ephesus
within this hour i was his bondman sir
but he i thank him gnaw’d in two my cords
now am i dromio and his man unbound

egeon
i am sure you both of you remember me

dromio of ephesus
ourselves we do remember sir by you
for lately we were bound as you are now
you are not pinch’s patient are you sir

egeon
why look you strange on me you know me well

antipholus of ephesus
i never saw you in my life till now

egeon
o! grief hath chang’d me since you saw me last
and careful hours with time’s deformed hand
have written strange defeatures in my face
but tell me yet dost thou not know my voice

antipholus of ephesus
neither

egeon
dromio nor thou

dromio of ephesus
no trust me sir nor i

egeon
i am sure thou dost

dromio of ephesus
ay sir but i am sure i do not and whatsoever a man denies you are
now bound to believe him

egeon
not know my voice! o time’s extremity
hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue
in seven short years that here my only son
knows not my feeble key of untun’d cares
though now this grained face of mine be hid
in sap consuming winter’s drizzled snow
and all the conduits of my blood froze up
yet hath my night of life some memory
my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left
my dull deaf ears a little use to hear
all these old witnesses i cannot err
tell me thou art my son antipholus

antipholus of ephesus
i never saw my father in my life

egeon
but seven years since in syracusa boy
thou know’st we parted but perhaps my son
thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery

antipholus of ephesus
the duke and all that know me in the city
can witness with me that it is not so
i ne’er saw syracusa in my life

duke
i tell thee syracusian twenty years
have i been patron to antipholus
during which time he ne’er saw syracusa
i see thy age and dangers make thee dote

 enter the abbess with antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse

abbess
most mighty duke behold a man much wrong’d

 all gather to see them

adriana
i see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me

duke
one of these men is genius to the other
and so of these which is the natural man
and which the spirit who deciphers them

dromio of syracuse
i sir am dromio command him away

dromio of ephesus
i sir am dromio pray let me stay

antipholus of syracuse
egeon art thou not or else his ghost

dromio of syracuse
o my old master who hath bound him here

abbess
whoever bound him i will loose his bonds
and gain a husband by his liberty
speak old egeon if thou be’st the man
that hadst a wife once called emilia
that bore thee at a burden two fair sons
o if thou be’st the same egeon speak
and speak unto the same emilia!

duke
why here begins his morning story right
these two antipholus’ these two so like
and these two dromios one in semblance
besides her urging of her wreck at sea
these are the parents to these children
which accidentally are met together

egeon
if i dream not thou art emilia
if thou art she tell me where is that son
that floated with thee on the fatal raft

abbess
by men of epidamnum he and i
and the twin dromio all were taken up
but by and by rude fishermen of corinth
by force took dromio and my son from them
and me they left with those of epidamnum
what then became of them i cannot tell
i to this fortune that you see me in

duke
antipholus thou cam’st from corinth first

antipholus of syracuse
no sir not i i came from syracuse

duke

antipholus of syracuse
and so do i yet did she call me so
and this fair gentlewoman her sister here
did call me brother what i told you then

if this be not a dream i see and hear

angelo
that is the chain sir which you had of me

antipholus of syracuse
i think it be sir i deny it not

antipholus of ephesus
and you sir for this chain arrested me

angelo

and dromio my man did bring them me
